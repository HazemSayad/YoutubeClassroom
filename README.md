# YoutubeClassroom
A tool to help Youtube students/learners to study with a charged up UI and tools to aid with the learning process

# Contributions
Contributions are welcome **BUT** any contribution to the code means you are signing off all rights to me. Reason is to prevent anyone from redistributing the code or commercially benefit from it. This is a tool to only help students, not benefit of them. 

## Guidelines
When creating a PR make sure whatever you change/add is well documented, clean, and explained. I want to thank you on behalf of every student who will benefit from your contributions, and another thank you for contributing to a better world.
